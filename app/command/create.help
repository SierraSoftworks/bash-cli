COMMAND  - The full name of the command you wish to create.
           Example: new command

This will create the files required to fully describe a command
to Bash CLI, specifically the <command>, <command>.usage and
<command>.help files. The correct directory structure to host
the command will be created, and .help files will be created
at each directory level.
