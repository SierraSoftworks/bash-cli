# This is a simple example how to add autocompletion to you command.
OPTIONS=("one" "two" "three")
echo ${OPTIONS[@]}


# You also might need to have access to arguments
# it could be done via `local_args_array=(${COMP_WORDS[@]:${cmd_arg_start}})`
# local_args_array will contain list of all argument after your command:
# for: cli example completion 1 2 3 4
# local_args_array  will be '1 2 3 4'
# You also could use fzf in here to make interactive selects.
